# Emacs configuration

This configuration was put together mostly by reading Emacs' built-in
documentation plus a bit of googling. It might not be optimal, even if I tried
as much as possible to use only code I understand.

Feel free to reuse parts or all of it. And of course comments to improve it in
any way are really welcome. :smile:
